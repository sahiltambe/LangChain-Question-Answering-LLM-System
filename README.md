# Astra DB and LangChain Question-Answering Demo

This project is a question-answering demo built using Astra DB and LangChain, powered by Vector Search. It showcases the integration of Astra DB, a cloud-native distributed database, and LangChain, a powerful language model, to provide accurate and efficient responses to user queries.

## Overview

The question-answering demo utilizes Astra DB's scalability and high availability features to store and retrieve data efficiently. LangChain, integrated with the demo, leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and generate accurate responses. The combination of these technologies enables the demo to deliver seamless and responsive question-answering capabilities.

## Features

- **Interactive Question-Answering**: Users can input questions through the demo interface, and the system will provide relevant answers based on the stored data.
  
- **Astra DB Integration**: Astra DB is used to store structured and unstructured data, providing a scalable and reliable storage solution for the demo.

- **LangChain Integration**: LangChain powers the natural language understanding and response generation processes, enabling the demo to interpret user queries accurately and provide meaningful answers.

- **Vector Search**: The demo leverages vector search techniques to enhance the accuracy of response retrieval, ensuring that users receive the most relevant information.

## Getting Started

To run the question-answering demo locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies for the demo by running the appropriate package manager command (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

3. **Configuration**: Set up the necessary configurations for Astra DB and LangChain integration. Refer to the project documentation for detailed instructions.

4. **Run the Demo**: Start the demo application and navigate to the provided URL to access the question-answering interface.

## Usage

Once the demo is running, users can interact with the question-answering interface by entering their queries into the provided input field. The system will process the query, retrieve relevant information from Astra DB, and generate an appropriate response using LangChain.
